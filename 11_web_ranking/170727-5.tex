\solution

Given the formula of PersonalizedPageRank
%
\begin{align*}
  r_{k+1}(i)^\top = \alpha r_k(i)^\top \Pi + (1 - \alpha)r_0(i)^\top
\end{align*}
%
where $r_0(i) = e_i$ and $0 \le \alpha \le 1$, we compute the CoSimRank as
%
\begin{align*}
  s(i, j) = \frac{1}{1 - c} \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty c^k \left\langle r_k(i),\
  r_k(j) \right\rangle
\end{align*}
%
where $0 \le c \le 1$ and $\frac{1}{1 - c}$ is the normalization factor, since
we want to compute a similarity such that $0 \le s(i, j) \le 1$. This factor is
given by
%
\begin{align*}
  \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty c^k \left\langle r_k(i),\ r_k(j) \right\rangle \le
  \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty c^k = \frac{1}{1 - c}
\end{align*}
%
Notice that we usually compute just few iterations of the sum, since the factor
$c^k$ converges to 0 very fast. Notice also that $\left\langle r_k(i),\ r_k(j)
\right\rangle$ represents the \emph{cosine similarity with norm-1} between
$r_k(i)$ and $r_k(j)$, in fact
%
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\left\langle r_k(i),\ r_k(j) \right\rangle}{\left\lVert r_k(i)
  \right\rVert_1 \cdot \left\lVert r_k(j) \right\rVert_1} = \left\langle
  r_k(i),\ r_k(j) \right\rangle
\end{align*}
%
since the norm-1 of a probability vector is 1.

CoSimRank can be seen as the similarity between the vector of probabilities of
two weighted random walks started from different nodes of a graph, where the
farthest is the step within the graph, the less it counts in the final
computation of the similarity.

It substitutes PersonalizedPageRank when, instead of a rank, we want to compute
similarities between pages, users, or other kind of nodes of a graph.
