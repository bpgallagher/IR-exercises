Given an annotator, such as TagMe, show how you could empower the TF-IDF vector
representation in order to perform ``semantic'' comparisons between documents by
using still the cosine similarity.

\solution

Let $v_i$ be the TF-IDF vector of a document $d_i$ (e.g., a column of the TF-IDF
matrix in Exercise \ref{10_text_ranking:tfid}). Note that $v_i$ has one
component for each term in the collection.

We can augment $v_i$ with $w$ components, that represent the relatedness between
$d_i$ and some concepts $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_w$.
The concepts can be explicitly defined by humans, or be the set of
Wikipedia articles. In the latter case, $w$ is the size of Wikipedia and the
extra components are the relevance of the Wikipedia articles to $d_i$.

In this setting, a topic annotator can help to get a score of the relatedness
between the document and a concept.

Given another document $d_j$, we can perform a semantic comparison with the dot
product between the $d_i$'s and $d_j$'s augmented vectors.
