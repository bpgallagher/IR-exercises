\exercise

In the context of a text annotator like TagMe, define
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item the link probability of an anchor text $a$ with respect to the Wikipedia
    knowledge graph, and
  \item the commonness of the link between an anchor $a$ and a Wikipedia page
    $p$.
\end{itemize}

\solution
\label{13_annotators:tagme}

If we denote by $freq(a)$ the number of times the text $a$ occurs in Wikipedia,
and by $link(a)$ the number of times $a$ occurs as an anchor in Wikipedia, then
the link probability that an occurrence of $a$ is set as an anchor is
%
$$lp(a)=\frac{link(a)}{freq(a)}.$$

The \emph{prior}-probability (commonness) that an occurrence of an anchor $a$
points to a page $p$ belonging to the set of Wikipedia pages linked by $a$ is
%
$$\mathbb{P}(p \mid a)=\frac{link_p(a)}{link(a)},$$
%
where $link_p(a) \leq link(a)$ is the number of times that $a$ points to
$p$.
