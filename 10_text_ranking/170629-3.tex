\exercise

Consider the WAND algorithm over four postings lists by assuming that at some
step the algorithm is examining the heads of the following lists:
\begin{align*}
  t_1 & \rightarrow \dots, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11    \\
  t_2 & \rightarrow \dots, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11 \\
  t_3 & \rightarrow \dots, 8, 13, 15         \\
  t_4 & \rightarrow \dots, 4, 5, 8, 9. 
\end{align*}
%
At that time the current threshold equals 2.3, and the upper bounds of the
scores in each posting list are: $ub_1 = 0.4$, $ub_2 = 2$, $ub_3 = 4$,
$ub_4 = 0.1$. Which is the next docID whose full score is computed? (Motivate
your answer)

\solution

We begin by sorting the postings according to their current docID:
%
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  t_2 & \rightarrow \dots, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11 \qquad & ub_2 &= 2    \\  
  t_4 & \rightarrow \dots, 4, 5, 8, 9               & ub_4 &= 0.1  \\  
  t_1 & \rightarrow \dots, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11           & ub_1 &= 0.4  \\
  t_3 & \rightarrow \dots, 8, 13, 15                & ub_3 &= 4.
\end{alignat*}

We next sum the upper bounds in the above order until we get a value greater
than or equal to the threshold $\theta=2.3$:
%
$$2 + 0.1 + 0.4 = ub_2 + ub_4 + ub_1 \geq \theta.$$
%
We call ``pivot'' the current docID in the posting list associated to the
last upper bound in the above sum; in our case the pivot is 5.

Since every document $d$ in the top-k results has a score $r(d) \geq \theta$,
we prune away all the docIDs less than the pivot:
%
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  t_2 & \rightarrow \dots, 5, 7, 8, 11           & ub_2 &= 2    \\  
  t_4 & \rightarrow \dots, 5, 8, 9               & ub_4 &= 0.1  \\  
  t_1 & \rightarrow \dots, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 \qquad & ub_1 &= 0.4  \\
  t_3 & \rightarrow \dots, 8, 13, 15             & ub_3 &= 4.
\end{alignat*}

Now, given that 5 appear as current docID in enough postings, we can compute
the (presumably slow) scoring function between the query vector and the document
vector, and see whether the document 5 enters or not in the top-k results. Note
that, in the former case, $\theta$ must be updated to reflect the new results.
