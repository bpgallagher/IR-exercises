Show the Rocchio's formula and comment on its application and its pros/cons.

\solution

Given the original query vector $q_0$, three weights $\alpha,\beta,\gamma
\geq 0$, the set of relevant documents $D_r$, and the set of non-relevant
documents $D_{nr}$, the modified query vector is
%
$$q_m = \alpha q_0 + \beta\frac{1}{\left|D_r\right|} \sum_{d_j\in D_r}d_j -
  \gamma\frac{1}{\left|D_{nr}\right|} \sum_{d_j\in D_{nr}}d_j.$$

The above formula moves the original query vector toward the centroid of
relevant documents, possibly improving the system's recall.

One possible drawback is that the set of (non-)relevant documents is unknown
and the user may be reluctant to provide feedback on query results.
