Describe the data structure and query algorithm that solves the 1-error match in
a dictionary of strings.

\solution

Given a set of strings $D$, we construct a $D'$ with all the possible
1-deletions of the words contained in $D$, for example:
%
\begin{align*}
  D &= \{ \texttt{bingo}, \dots \} \\
  D' &= \{ \texttt{bing}, \texttt{bino}, \texttt{bngo}, \texttt{ingo}, \dots \}
\end{align*}
%
Then:
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item in order to find 1-insertions, we compute all 1-deletions from the query
  string and we search them in $D$;

  \item in order to find 1-deletions, we search the query string in $D'$;

  \item in order to find 1-substitutions, we compute all 1-deletions from the
  query string and we search them in $D'$;

  \item in order to find an exact match, we simply do an exact search in $D$.

\end{itemize}
